      <p className="adoption-foster-content">
        Adopting or fostering a pet isn't just about finding a new addition to
        your family or providing a temporary home; it's about giving a loving
        environment to an animal in need. Each adoption or fostering from the
        Pet Adoption Hub supports our mission of promoting responsible pet
        ownership and ending pet homelessness. When you choose adoption or
        fostering, you're not just changing one life; you're changing two.
